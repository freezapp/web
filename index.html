            FreezApp is a project developed by Computer Science students from
            FCT NOVA (Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia da Universidade Nova de
            Lisboa), with the aim of exploring practical applications of
            human-computer interaction and intuitive interface design.
          </p>
          <p class="section-p">
            Our goal is not only to design an app, but also to reflect on how
            thoughtful interfaces can change everyday habits and improve user
            experience.

          <p class="section-p">
            Check out our work and follow along with our first prototype—we hope
            FreezApp inspires you to see technology as a way to make life

        <h3>Stage 1: Project Proposal</h3>

        <h4><b>Description:</b></h4>
        <p>
          In this initial stage, we focused on identifying a real-world problem
          related to food waste and brainstorming potential solutions. After
          thorough research and discussions, we proposed the idea of FreezApp,
          an application designed to help users manage their frozen food
          inventory effectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          The proposal included defining the app's core features, target
          audience, and the overall user experience we aimed to create. We also
          outlined our project timeline and milestones to ensure a structured
          development process.
        </p>

        <h3>Stage 2: User and task analysis</h3>

        <h4><b>Description:</b></h4>
        <p>
          In this stage, you should examine and understand the problem space. Who are the
          main users of the system? What tasks users want to perform with the system? What
          functionalities should be made available by the system? How is the work
          environment?
        </p>
        <p>
          This stage should include:
          <ul>
            <li>User analysis: Identify the characteristics of the target user population.
            Multiple user classes may exist, identify each one of them.</li>
            <li>Task analysis: Determine the tasks that should be allowed by your system and 
            analyse their characteristics. You should find and analyse 3-6 high-level tasks.
            Each of these high-level tasks should have a goal and subtasks.</li>
            <li>Scenario design: Create 3 different scenarios (a concrete example of tasks
            performed in a hypothetical interface) that include the tasks considered in the
            task analysis.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Stage 3: 1st Prototype</h3>

        <h4><b>Description:</b></h4>
        <p>
          We developed and evaluated the first prototype of our system. It was a throw-away prototype, 
          which we ensured could handle at least three scenarios described in the task analysis.
          Our colleagues and Professor tested the prototype during the lab class.
        </p>
        <p>
          This stage should include:
          <ul>
            <li>Sketches: Your first approach to the design to show how your interface would look
            at key points of the interaction.</li>
            <li>Prototype photos: Photos of the relevant pieces of your prototypes (also take
            photos in the testing day)</li>
            <li>Storyboards: Sequence of fixed screens showing the interaction to perform a
            relevant task.</li>
            <li>
            Briefing: The briefing provided to the users.
            </li>
            <li>
            Scenarios: Scenario descriptions provided to the users.
            </li>
            <li>
            Observation: Usability problems found during the tests and possible solutions. Describe user comments without identifying them.

        <h3>Stage 4: Functional prototype</h3>

        <p>
        In this stage, according to the results obtained during the first prototype user tests, you are
        going to develop a functional prototype.
        </p>

        <h4><b>Objective:</b></h4>
        <p>Develop a functional prototype of an interactive system.</p>
        
        <h4><b>Description:</b></h4>
        <p>
          According to the results you got from the first prototype user tests in stage 3, you should
          create a new prototype running on the appropriate platform (web, mobile). This prototype
          should be:
        </p>
          <ul>
            <li>High fidelity in look: explore the graphic design of your final application. Make
            choices about screen layout, colours, fonts, alignment, icons... </li>
            <li>High fidelity in feel: the prototype should behave as the real system.
            It is supposed to run on the appropriate platform (web, mobile). </li>
            <li>Medium fidelity in breath: support, at least, the scenarios and tasks tested in stage 3.</li>
            <li>Low fidelity in depth: don’t need to put much work on the backend.</li>
          </ul>

        <p>
          Your prototype does not need to be functionally complete, but should be complete enough
          to give a convincing impression to candidate users. This prototype will be distributed to
          another group of students from your practical class, so they will do a heuristic evaluation
          of your prototype and produce an evaluation report during the next project stage.
        </p>
        <p>You can use any appropriate tool to develop your prototype (html, React native, ...). </p>

      <h4><b>Report:</b></h4>
        <p>The report must include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>URL for your prototype:</b> make your prototype available for downloading (or
          use in case of a website) and include the corresponding URL in the report.</li>
          <li><b>Startup instructions:</b> Specify the platform and software requirements to run
          your prototype. Give brief instructions for starting it up.</li>
          <li><b>“Briefing”:</b> the “briefing” you gave to the users in stage 3, describing your
          application (with the necessary adjustments).</li>
          <li><b>Scenarios:</b> developed during stage 3 to help evaluators understand and evaluate
          your application.</li>
          <li><b>URL of your project:</b> So evaluators have access to your project history, which
          will help them to understand your application.</li>
          <li>Also describe which parts of your prototype are incomplete, so evaluators know
          what is supposed to work and what is not.</li>
          <li>…don’t forget to describe your application and to identify the tools you used to
          develop it.</li>
        </ul>
